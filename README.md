# C-Rank

C-Rank is an unsupervised keyphrase extraction algorithm that uses Concept Linking in order to improve its results.

It does not need external data to be inputted by the user other than the document to have its keyphrases extracted.

It is necessary to create an account to Babelfy (http://babelfy.org/login) as C-Rank uses its services. Then, Babelfy key must be inserted in the python code in order to C-Rank work properly.

The code will be properly presented and managed in the next few days.
